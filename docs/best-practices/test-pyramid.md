# Number of UI Tests

Out of the three major test automation types (Unit Tests, API Tests and UI Tests), the UI tests are the slowest and you should 
be writing more Unit Tests and API (Integration) tests. The UI tests are expensive to create, run and maintain. Imagine a pyramid 
and the bottom part of the pyramid is the number of unit tests. The middle part is the number is API tests. The upper part would
be the number of UI tests. That is what is called a test pyramid and shows the ideal ratio of the types of automated tests you should have. 

Compared to unit test and integration tests, UI tests are slower to run and flaky as well. The results cannot be hundred percent 
reliable and we should avoid them being a criteria for deployment if possible. 

These reasons make it imperative that you should be choosing your UI tests carefully. The testing via UI has its own advantages though.
When you test a UI, you might be testing hundreds of APIs. These APIs utilise hundreds or thousands of functions in the core application 
to run. So in effect you are indirectly testing APIs and core function methods. This should be taken with a grain of salt because, 
eventhough you are testing all these, you may not exactly know the failure points.
