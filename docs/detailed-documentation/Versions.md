            <artifactId>wave</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
```

Gradle:

```yml
implementation group: 'io.github.tidal-code', name: 'wave', version: '1.2.0'

### Version 1.1.0

Added custom expectation failure message.

Example:
```java
find("#invisibleElement").expecting(toBePresent).orElseFail("The element expected to be present, but failed to fulfill the condition");
```

This would cause an assertion failure with the custom message given.


### Version 1.0.1

```Upgrade to native Selenium Manager from WebDriver Manager.```

Selenium has integrated Boni Garc√≠a's WebDriver manager to the core Selenium library.

### Version 1.0.0

```Initial version release.```
