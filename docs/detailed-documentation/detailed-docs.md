# Detailed Documentation

You can find detailed functional documentation about the project in this section's child pages. 

Most of the functions are designed as static fluent APIs. The `find()` and `findAll()`
methods are the base for most user actions. Most action methods are designed to emulate user interactions with a Web Application.

The framework will wait until the overlay spinners blocking an operation is disappeared. Iframes will be automatically switched to find the right 
element. These two core operations will reduce the Test Automation engineer's efforts by a great amount. 
Typically they would need to spend time to fix these impediments for UI automation.

To begin your understanding about the process to interact with a Web UI, we assume that you
are familiar with how to locate an element. If not; you can find the details [here.](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/locators/){:target='_blank'} Once you identify the 
locator, pass that information to Wave UI Automation library as a string. There is no option to pass ***Selenium
By locator***. Instead you have to prefix the locator type with your locator.

Example:
```java
find("id:some_id").click();
````
<small> More examples can be found in the ***Locators*** page. </small>


More Examples:

```java
find("class:some_class").click();
find("css:css selector").click();
find("linkText:Selenium").click();
```


For Xpath and Text selectors you do not need to prefix anything. Just add them as is. 

Demo Button Example:

<span class="fs-3">
[Demo Button](){: .btn .btn-purple .xs}
</span>

```java
find("Demo Button").click();
```

For finding Xpaths, use as below

```java
find("//span/a[text()='Demo Button']")
```


{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
