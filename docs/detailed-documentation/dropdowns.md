# Dropdowns

Typical dropdown with input type as \'select\' can be interacted with using three
methods 

```java
select(String selectText); //Visible text in the dropdown
select(String value); //value of select elements
select(int index); //index value of elements
```

Many web applications may not have dropdown types as \'select\'. You might need to add extra
user interations to select an element from those types of dropdowns.
